### Creating a Virtual Environment

Before installing the dependencies, it's recommended to create a Python virtual environment. This isolates your project dependencies from other Python projects. Here's how you can set it up:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (replace 'env' with the name of your environment)
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On MacOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
